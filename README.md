# Commercial-Data-Analysis-with-Power-BI

This mini-project serves as an introduction to commercial data analysis using Power BI. The goal is to build several visualizations that allow us to analyze the sales performance of a fictional company from multiple perspectives. Using fictional data provided by Data Science Academy, we explore key features of Power BI, such as Smart Narrative, Key Influencers, Ribbon Chart, and custom menu creation for the dashboard index.

Throughout this project, we focus on visualizing data to gain insights into sales patterns, identifying key drivers of performance, and providing decision-makers with a clear understanding of sales performance across different dimensions. This hands-on project emphasizes the importance of storytelling with data, combining analytics with intuitive visualization to drive insights.
